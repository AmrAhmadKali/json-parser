Welcome to Fuzzgoat
===================

This C program has been deliberately backdoored with several memory corruption bugs to test the efficacy of fuzzers and other analysis tools. Each vulnerability is clearly commented in fuzzgoat.c. Under input-files/ are files to trigger each vulnerability.

CAUTION: Do not copy any of this code - there is evil stuff in this repo.
